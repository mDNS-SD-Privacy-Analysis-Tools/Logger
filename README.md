# Logger

These __python 3.5__ scripts require the installation of 'requests' (used for REST-requests to the server) and 'zeroconf' (used for service discovery)
-> Both are installable via pip (pip install requests | pip install zeroconf)
The config file (conf/settings.cfg) has to contain a valid URL to the database server.

Use python mdnsLogger.py to run the script
